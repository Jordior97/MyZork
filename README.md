Welcome to 'Simon & Baxter: the Magical Stones'

It's an interactive textual game in which you have to explore

a fantasy world full of enemies and challenges to get magical stones. 

Whith their power you will be able to defeat Rakdos, the Devil King


*INSTRUCTIONS:*

The **BASIC COMMANDS** that you can enter:: go / look / open (direction) door / close (direction) door / help / quit.


To specify the **DIRECTION** you want: north(n) / south(s) / east(e) / west(w) / up(u) / down(d)


To **INTERACT** with **OBJECTS** you can introduce these commands:

pick / drop <item> = to put items in your inventory / leave items\nin the room you are.

equip / unequip <item> = to equip/unequip items that are in the inventory.

put <item> into <containter> = to put an item into another item (container).

get <item> from <containter> = to get an item that's inside\nanother item container).

look trunk = to look items that are inside this container.


To know basic **INFORMATION** related to the character:

You can't see which objects are in the room when you move between them.

To see the items, you have to insert the command 'look'.

inventory / inv / i = it shows all the items the player is carrying.

equipment(eq) = it shows the equipped items.

stats(st) = to look the statistics of the character.


**SPECIAL FEATURE: WormHole**

You have to think twice before dropping an item. Why? Because of the physical 

laws of this world, a wormhole is created when you drop items, making them appear into another room. 

If you want to keep your items safe, you have to put them into the trunk.

P.D.:	
- En alguns dels commits que vaig realitzar, el nom i el correu que estaven establerts eren erronis, d'un altre usuari.
	
- In the final room (Rakdos Throne Room), you can cross it to return to the bedroom without doing anything. 
  I want to implement, in the future, a 'win condition' to detect if you defeated Rakdos. 
  Then, you can return to the real world.

- You can find the magical gems distributed all over the map, but you can't use them at the moment. I will implement their 		  functionality in a future release, after implementing combat mechanics and enemies

- I will implement a dragon that appears in the "Dragon Chamber" every 30 seconds, so you can fight and defeat him to get experience 	  and gold(future implementations);
