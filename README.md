P.D.:	
- En un dels commits que vaig realitzar, el nom i el correu que estaven establerts eren erronis, d'un altre usuari.
	
- In the final room (Rakdos Throne Room), you can cross it to return to the bedroom without doing anything. 
  I want to implement, in the future, a 'win condition' to detect if you defeated Rakdos. 
  Then, you can return to the real world.
